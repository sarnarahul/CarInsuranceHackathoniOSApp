# Generic Car Insurance App for Intership Position at Stony Brook's R&D Park

According to the given specifications for the App,

I had to code various parts for an employee to save car information and persist it. 

I used Core Data to persist along with UITableViews and Custom Views to Capture Information 

My myStonyGram iOS App taught me a lot of techniques to improve my code with learning and applying new code strategies.

With a good amount of experience in Core Data, I was able to code this for the 7 hour internship hackathon in 5 hours.
